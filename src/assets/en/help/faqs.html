                                    access to all its new channels, so that they
                                    can take advantage of all these technologies
                                    and use whichever is appropriate at a
                                    particular time. By registering for all
                                    services at once, we can simplify the
                                    allocation of user identifications and
                                    passwords.<br>Q:
                                    Suppose I am already registered for Phone
                                    Banking?<br>
                                    A:
                                    In that case, you can already use IVR Phone
                                    Banking and WAP Phone Banking. All you need
                                    to do now is to log on to <i>Al Mubasher</i><br>Internet
                                    Banking for the first time, to complete the
                                    registration.<br>
                                    Q:
                                    What steps must I go through, in order to
                                    register? What information will I need?<br>
                                    A:
                                    You will need your Al Rajhi Bank ATM card (the one you
                                    use to draw money from a cash machine), and
                                    the account number of your Current Account,
                                    in order to register. You then need to go to
                                    the <u>Registration</u> page, where you will
                                    be taken through the following steps
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Enter
                                    your ATM card number (the 16-digit number on
                                    the front of the card), the Account Number
                                    of your Current Account, and the 4-digit PIN
                                    you use with your ATM card. This is a
                                    security procedure that lets us confirm your
                                    identity as a customer.</li>
                                    <li>You
                                    will then be shown a copy of the Terms and
                                    Conditions for using these services, and
                                    asked to show your agreement by clicking the
                                    "Accept" button</li>
                                    <li>We
                                    will then tell you your Customer Number.
                                    This is a number, up to 8 digits, that you
                                    will use to identify yourself to IVR Phone
                                    Banking, WAP Phone Banking, and Internet
                                    Banking.</li>
                                    <li>You
                                    will then be asked to enter three 4-digit
                                    PIN�s. The first one is used to access IVR
                                    Phone Banking, WAP Phone Banking, and
                                    Internet Banking. The second and third are
                                    used for particular services within IVR
                                    Phone Banking</li>
                                    <li>At
                                    this point, you will now be able to log on
                                    to IVR Phone Banking and WAP Phone Banking,
                                    using the Customer Number we supplied you,
                                    and the first PIN that you entered</li>
                                    <li>In
                                    order to log on to Internet Banking, you
                                    need to go through two final stages.</li>
                                    <li>You
                                    will be given the option to change your
                                    numeric Customer Number to a Customer
                                    Identification that can be a mixture of
                                    letters and numbers, for use when you log on
                                    to Internet Banking. You may want to do this
                                    if you want to create a name that is easier
                                    to remember. For example, you may want to
                                    change Customer Number <i>12345678</i> to
                                    Customer Identification <i>Mohammad321</i>,
                                    for use on the Internet. However, you will
                                    still need to use your Customer Number for
                                    Phone Banking services, so you do not need
                                    to make this change if you just want one
                                    thing to remember.</li>
                                    <li>For
                                    improved security, we require an 8-digit
                                    password when accessing the Internet. You
                                    will therefore be asked to enter an
                                    8-character password for accessing the
                                    Internet.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Q:
                                    Why would I want to change my Customer
                                    Number to Customer Identification?<br>
                                    A:
                                    Some people will mainly use Internet
                                    Banking, and prefer to have an identifier,
                                    for example <i>faisalalra</i>, that is more
                                    meaningful to them.
                                    They will therefore change their Customer
                                    Number. Other people will make equal use of
                                    Internet and Phone Banking, and therefore
                                    prefer to use the same Customer Number for
                                    all services.<br>
                                    Q:
                                    Do I have to register using the Internet?<br>
                                    A:
                                    You can also perform the initial
                                    registration steps through IVR Phone Banking.
                                    However you will of course need to use the
                                    Internet finally to log on to Internet
                                    Banking.

                                    When is the service available?<br>
                                    A:

                                    On occasion the service will be taken down
                                    for essential maintenance; this will be
                                    scheduled for times when the impact is
                                    minimal, for example the early hours of the
                                    morning KSA time.<br>

                                    updated?<br>
                                    A:
                                    Current Account balances and transaction
                                    details are updated whenever transactions
                                    occur.
                                    Details for other account types (e.g. Credit
                                    Cards) are updated overnight.<br>

                                    A:
                                    Transfers to other accounts that you hold
                                    with the Bank will take place immediately.
                                    Transfers to other accounts, within and
                                    outside the Kingdom, will take longer.<br>

                                    Q:
                                    How do I find out how to use the various
                                    services within <i>Al Mubasher</i> Internet
                                    Banking?<br>
                                    A:
                                    The service has been designed to be as easy
                                    to use as possible, with pages being
                                    designed as forms that can be easily
                                    completed. However, for additional
                                    assistance, each page has a "Help"
                                    button giving access to a Help screen.
                                    The Help screen describes the purpose of
                                    each screen, the items to be completed, the
                                    expected results, and the meaning of any
                                    error messages.

                                    Q:
                                    What happens if I make a mistake? Can I
                                    correct it?<br>
                                    A:
                                    Many of the pages within <i>Al Mubasher</i>
                                    Internet Banking merely display information,
                                    therefore it is not possible to make a
                                    mistake.
                                    For one transaction type, that is transfers
                                    between your own accounts, it is possible to
                                    correct a wrong transaction by doing another
                                    transaction in the opposite direction. In
                                    other cases, specifically transactions that
                                    pay money into someone else�s account, it
                                    is not possible to change these transactions
                                    once they have been made. It is therefore
                                    important that you ensure that the
                                    information you have submitted is correct,
                                    before confirming the transaction.

                                  Remittance system. Money is routed to the bank

                                  receiving the money), through the
